  "explanation_short": "This transaction has a low suspiciousness probability (0.1086) because it was processed by credit card, is not an ACH transfer, and involves a moderate, matching paid/received amount; these factors reduce indicators of concern. The use of Swiss francs, however, elevates scrutiny and is the primary factor increasing risk.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 \u2014 absence of an ACH transfer reduces indicators linked to automated account-to-account movement.\n- Payment Format_Credit Card = 1.0 \u2014 credit card use tends to decrease risk due to established payment\u2011processor controls and traceability.\n- Amount Paid = 429.11 \u2014 a moderate transaction amount, which typically lowers suspicion compared with high\u2011value transfers.\n- Amount Received = 429.11 \u2014 identical paid and received amounts reduce signs of layering or value divergence.\n- Payment Currency_Swiss Franc = 1.0 \u2014 use of Swiss francs increases scrutiny due to jurisdictional and correspondent\u2011banking considerations."
