  "explanation_short": "This transaction is assessed as low risk, with a suspiciousness probability of 0.0248, because several features associated with lower concern outweigh a single modest risk indicator. Payment via credit card, the absence of ACH, the transaction amount profile, and the receiving currency all contribute to lowering suspicion, while the reported Amount Paid produces a small countervailing signal.",
