  "explanation_short": "This transaction has a low suspiciousness probability (0.0145) because several observed attributes align with lower-risk patterns. The combination of payment format, matching amounts, and transaction timing reduces indicators of unusual activity.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 \u2014 absence of ACH use is associated here with lower suspicion.\n- Amount Received = 823.03 \u2014 a moderate received amount that does not appear unusual in isolation, decreasing concern.\n- Amount Paid = 823.03 \u2014 equal paid and received amounts suggest no unexplained value transfer, reducing suspicion.\n- Payment Format_Cheque = 1.0 \u2014 use of cheque in this instance is associated with lower risk.\n- Hour = 21.0 \u2014 transaction time (21:00) in this context is associated with lower suspicion."
