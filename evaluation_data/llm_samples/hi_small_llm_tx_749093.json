  "explanation_short": "The assessed suspiciousness probability of 0.1539 indicates a low level of concern for this transaction. This rating is driven down by a modest, matching payment and receipt amount, a common ACH payment format, and timing that falls in a typical midweek midday period consistent with routine activity.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Amount Paid = 38.35 \u2014 decreases suspicion; relatively small value consistent with routine payments.\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 \u2014 decreases suspicion; ACH is a standard, traceable payment method.\n- Amount Received = 38.35 \u2014 decreases suspicion; identical received and paid amounts reduce indicators of layering or value mismatch.\n- Weekday = 3.0 \u2014 decreases suspicion; occurs on a midweek business day rather than unusual timing.\n- Hour = 13.0 \u2014 decreases suspicion; occurs during normal business hours (early afternoon)."
