  "explanation_short": "This transaction has a relatively low suspiciousness score (0.2895). The moderately large payment amount and the late evening hour push the score upward, while the fact it is a cheque, not an ACH payment, and the weekday of the transaction reduce overall concern.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Amount Paid = 1330.78 (increases suspicion: higher monetary value increases monitoring relevance)\n- Hour = 20.0 (increases suspicion: late-evening timing is more atypical and raises attention)\n- Payment Format_Cheque = 1.0 (decreases suspicion: cheque payment here is associated with lower risk)\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 (decreases suspicion: not an ACH transfer in this instance)\n- Weekday = 2.0 (decreases suspicion: timing within the week is associated with lower risk)"
