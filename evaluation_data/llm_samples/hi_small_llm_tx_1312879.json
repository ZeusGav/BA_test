  "explanation_short": "This transaction is assessed at a low-to-moderate level of concern (21.18%) because the ACH payment format raises an indicator of elevated risk while other transaction characteristics reduce overall suspicion. Relatively small, equal incoming and outgoing amounts and an early-week, early-hour timestamp are consistent with routine activity, lowering the score.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Payment Format_ACH = 1.0 \u2014 increases suspicion due to use of ACH, which can be associated with higher-risk account-to-account transfers.\n- Weekday = 4.0 and Hour = 5.0 \u2014 decrease suspicion as the timing aligns with routine processing windows rather than atypical patterns.\n- Amount Received = 200.22 and Amount Paid = 200.22 \u2014 decrease suspicion because the amounts are modest and matched, consistent with routine transfers rather than large or irregular flows."
