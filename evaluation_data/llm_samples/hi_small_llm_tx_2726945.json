  "explanation_short": "This transaction is assigned a very low suspiciousness probability (0.0002) because its observed attributes align with patterns associated with lower-risk activity. Several transaction characteristics reduce concern rather than raise it.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- SameBank = 1.0 \u2014 intra-bank movement, which lowers settlement and counterparty complexity and therefore decreases suspicion.\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 \u2014 processed via a standard ACH format, a common and traceable payment method that decreases suspicion.\n- Receiving Currency_Australian Dollar = 1.0 \u2014 payment in AUD, consistent with expected local-currency flows and thus decreases suspicion.\n- Hour = 21.0 \u2014 timing falls within patterns seen with routine activity for this profile and decreases suspicion.\n- Amount Paid = 1367151.92 \u2014 although large in nominal terms, the amount aligns with expected legitimate high-value activity for the account profile and decreases suspicion."
