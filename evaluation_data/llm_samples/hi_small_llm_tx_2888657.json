  "explanation_short": "This transaction has a very low suspiciousness probability (0.0080) because the observed attributes align with lower-risk characteristics. The payment method (cheque), absence of ACH, moderate received amount, early-hour timing, and use of Brazil Real do not indicate heightened concern in this case.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 \u2014 absence of ACH payment; associated here with lower risk.\n- Amount Received = 3813.07 \u2014 a moderate value that does not indicate high-value layering or structuring.\n- Hour = 5.0 \u2014 transaction occurred early in the day, which in this context is associated with lower risk.\n- Payment Format_Cheque = 1.0 \u2014 payment by cheque rather than an electronic transfer, reducing immediate concern.\n- Receiving Currency_Brazil Real = 1.0 \u2014 payment in Brazil Real does not increase risk for this profile."
