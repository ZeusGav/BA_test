  "explanation_short": "The transaction has a low suspiciousness probability because its observed characteristics align with typical, low-risk activity for this profile. Payment method, currency, timing, and the received amount all point toward reduced concern.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Payment format: credit card used (Payment Format_Credit Card = 1.0), which in this context is associated with lower risk.\n- Payment format: ACH not used (Payment Format_ACH = 0.0), reducing indicators of concern compared with ACH activity.\n- Timing: occurred on weekday = 4 (Thursday), consistent with normal business-day patterns and lowering suspicion.\n- Currency and amount: received in Indian Rupee (Receiving Currency_Rupee = 1.0) for an amount of 57,763.11, which is consistent with expected flows and decreases risk."
