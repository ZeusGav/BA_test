  "explanation_short": "This transaction is assessed as low risk because the available attributes align with lower-risk patterns: it was processed by credit card, not ACH, is denominated in Canadian dollars, occurred mid-week, and the payment amount is in the observed mid-range. No high-risk indicators are present among the top factors considered, which leads to a low suspiciousness probability.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Payment made by credit card, which in this profile reduces suspicion.\n- Not an ACH payment, the absence of ACH decreases suspicion.\n- Receiving currency is Canadian dollar, which decreases suspicion.\n- Payment amount of 39,191.51, a level that reduces concern in this context.\n- Transaction occurred on weekday 4 (mid-week), which decreases suspicion."
