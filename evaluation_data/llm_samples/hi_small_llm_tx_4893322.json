  "explanation_short": "The transaction is assigned a very low suspiciousness probability (0.0005) because the observed attributes align with lower-risk patterns. The combination of payment format, small and matching amounts, absence of ACH routing, and the transaction hour do not exhibit indicators typically associated with elevated risk.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Payment Format_Wire = 1.0 \u2014 routed as a wire transfer, which in this context corresponds to routine bank-to-bank movement and reduces concern.\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 \u2014 no ACH routing, removing a channel that can sometimes be linked to higher-risk settlement behavior.\n- Amount Received = 273.57 \u2014 the transaction value is relatively low, lowering monetary risk indicators.\n- Amount Paid = 273.57 \u2014 equal paid and received amounts suggest no obvious value manipulation or layering in this single event.\n- Hour = 1.0 \u2014 the transaction time falls into a period that, based on expected customer behavior, does not raise timing-related concerns."
