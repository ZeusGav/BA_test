  "explanation_short": "The transaction\u2019s suspiciousness probability is relatively low (about 17.7%) because several observed attributes are consistent with lower-risk patterns, though one attribute increases concern. Overall, the combination of payment format, settled currency, and the received amount reduce suspicion while the matching outbound payment raises a note of caution.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 (decreases suspicion): no ACH involvement, which in this context is associated with lower risk.\n- Payment Format_Cheque = 1.0 (decreases suspicion): the payment was processed by cheque, a format here linked to reduced concern.\n- Amount Received = 956.4 (decreases suspicion): the received amount is moderate and consistent with expected customer activity.\n- Amount Paid = 956.4 (increases suspicion): the outgoing payment equals the incoming amount, which may indicate rapid passthrough and increases scrutiny.\n- Payment Currency_US Dollar = 1.0 (decreases suspicion): the transaction was settled in US dollars, a currency associated with lower contextual risk."
