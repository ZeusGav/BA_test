  "explanation_short": "This transaction is assessed as low risk (4.28%), primarily because it was processed as a cheque, not via ACH, occurred late in the evening, and involved a moderate incoming amount. The identical paid amount does introduce a limited increase in concern due to the immediate outbound of funds.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 \u2014 absence of ACH activity lowers assessed suspicion.\n- Payment Format_Cheque = 1.0 \u2014 cheque payment lowers assessed suspicion.\n- Amount Received = 4321.24 \u2014 moderate incoming amount lowers assessed suspicion.\n- Amount Paid = 4321.24 \u2014 identical outgoing amount increases assessed suspicion (raises attention for immediate outbound flow).\n- Hour = 21.0 \u2014 transaction time (21:00) lowers assessed suspicion."
