  "explanation_short": "This transaction is assessed as low risk (probability 0.15%) because several routine attributes reduce concern and outweigh a single higher-value element. Internal movement within the same account and bank, executed via ACH on a mid-week day, are consistent with ordinary activity, while the payment amount of $8,446.23 modestly increases the level of attention.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- SameAccount = 1.0 \u2014 transaction originates and settles within the same account, which decreases suspicion.\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 \u2014 use of ACH payment format is associated with routine, lower-risk processing and decreases suspicion.\n- SameBank = 1.0 \u2014 movement within the same bank reduces counterparty risk and decreases suspicion.\n- Amount Paid = 8446.23 \u2014 higher transfer value increases attention and contributes to elevated suspicion relative to smaller amounts.\n- Weekday = 3.0 \u2014 occurring mid-week is consistent with normal business timing and decreases suspicion."
