  "explanation_short": "This transaction is assessed as low risk (suspiciousness probability 0.0295) because the recorded attributes align with patterns the monitoring system associates with lower risk. No high-risk indicators appear among the top contributing factors.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 \u2014 absence of an ACH payment contributes to decreased suspicion.\n- Payment Format_Cash = 1.0 \u2014 presence of a cash payment indicator, in this context, contributes to decreased suspicion.\n- Amount Received = 373.11 \u2014 a moderate amount that reduces suspicion relative to higher-risk amounts.\n- Weekday = 4.0 \u2014 occurring on a weekday (Thursday) aligns with lower-risk activity patterns.\n- Hour = 17.0 \u2014 late-afternoon timing (5:00 PM) aligns with typical business hours and reduces suspicion."
