  "explanation_short": "This transaction has a low suspiciousness probability (0.0674, or 6.74%), indicating limited indicators of money laundering based on the reviewed attributes. The primary reasons are the use of a cheque in US dollars and the identical, modest paid and received amounts, together with the absence of ACH activity, which collectively reduce concern.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Absence of ACH payment (Payment Format_ACH = 0.0): no ACH channel detected, which here reduces suspicion.\n- Modest transaction amount (Amount Received = $184.82): relatively low value, which lowers the likelihood of layering/structuring.\n- Matching paid and received amounts (Amount Paid = $184.82): symmetry between inflow and outflow is consistent with a straightforward transfer.\n- Cheque payment in US dollars (Payment Format_Cheque = 1.0; Payment Currency_US Dollar = 1.0): payment method and currency align with patterns associated with lower risk in this context."
