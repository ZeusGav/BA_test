  "explanation_short": "The transaction has a low suspiciousness probability (0.02) because the observed attributes reduce indicators of risk. The payment amount, timing, weekday and use of a credit card are each associated with lower risk in the current monitoring context.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Amount Received = 83.83 \u2014 a modest incoming amount that does not elevate risk relative to typical thresholds.\n- Amount Paid = 83.83 \u2014 the paid amount matches the received amount, suggesting a straightforward, non-layered flow.\n- Hour = 3.0 \u2014 the transaction time (03:00) is, in this context, linked to lower risk for this account/product.\n- Payment Format_Credit Card = 1.0 \u2014 credit card use reduces anonymity and is therefore associated with lower transactional risk."
