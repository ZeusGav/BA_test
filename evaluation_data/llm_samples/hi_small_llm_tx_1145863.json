  "explanation_short": "This transaction is assigned a low suspiciousness probability (0.0407) because its observable attributes align with lower-risk patterns for the monitored population. The payment method, moderate amount, matching paid/received values, and the transaction hour all reduce indicators of concern.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 \u2014 absence of ACH transfers in this case is associated with lower risk.\n- Payment Format_Cheque = 1.0 \u2014 presence of a cheque payment here is linked to reduced concern.\n- Amount Received = 828.33 \u2014 a moderate received amount that is not unusually large for the profile decreases suspicion.\n- Amount Paid = 828.33 \u2014 identical paid and received amounts suggest no obvious layering or structuring.\n- Hour = 0.0 \u2014 the transaction time is associated with lower risk in the relevant monitoring context."
