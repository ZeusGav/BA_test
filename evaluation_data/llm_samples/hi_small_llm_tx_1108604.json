  "explanation_short": "This transaction receives a very low suspiciousness probability because the observed attributes align with routine, low-risk behavior and no high-risk signals were present. Factors such as intra-account movement, same-bank processing, local currency, a modest amount, and the transaction timing collectively decreased the assessed risk.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- SameAccount = 1.0 \u2014 movement stayed within the same account, which decreases suspicion.\n- SameBank = 1.0 \u2014 transaction occurred within the same bank, reducing counterparty risk.\n- Payment Currency = Yuan \u2014 use of local currency consistent with the account profile decreases cross-border/currency risk.\n- Amount Paid = 93.48 \u2014 relatively low transaction value, which lowers risk for layering or large-scale laundering.\n- Hour = 23.0 \u2014 late-evening timing was observed but did not increase suspicion in this case."
