  "explanation_short": "The transaction has a very low suspiciousness probability (0.0002) because its attributes are consistent with routine, low\u2011risk activity. In particular, it appears to be an intra\u2011account, intra\u2011bank ACH payment occurring at a time and weekday profile that reduces indicators of unusual behavior.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- SameAccount = 1.0 (decreases suspicion) \u2014 movement within the same account, reducing exposure to third\u2011party layering.\n- SameBank = 1.0 (decreases suspicion) \u2014 transaction stayed within the same bank, suggesting internal routing rather than external counterparties.\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 (decreases suspicion) \u2014 ACH format associated with standard clearing and lower operational risk in this context.\n- Hour = 0.0 (decreases suspicion) \u2014 transaction timing falls into a time window associated with lower risk.\n- Weekday = 3.0 (decreases suspicion) \u2014 occurred on a weekday typically associated with normal business activity."
