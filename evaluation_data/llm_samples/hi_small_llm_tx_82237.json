  "explanation_short": "This transaction is assessed as very low risk (probability 0.0001) because the observed attributes align with routine, low-value activity and no external counterparty exposure. The combination of same-account and same-bank movement, a small amount, a midnight timestamp, and a non-ACH payment format all reduce suspicion.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- SameAccount = 1.0 \u2014 decreases suspicion: funds moved within the same account, indicating no external counterparty exposure.\n- SameBank = 1.0 \u2014 decreases suspicion: both sides held at the same bank, reducing cross-institutional complexity.\n- Amount Paid = 3.65 \u2014 decreases suspicion: very low monetary value consistent with routine transactions.\n- Hour = 0.0 \u2014 decreases suspicion: timestamp at hour 0, consistent with scheduled or routine processing.\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 \u2014 decreases suspicion: payment is not in ACH format, associated here with lower risk."
