  "explanation_short": "The assessed suspiciousness is low (8.21%) because several attributes associated with lower concern outweigh the effect of the transaction amount. The relatively large amount does raise risk, but timing and payment-format indicators reduce overall suspicion.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 \u2014 absence of an ACH payment is associated here with decreased suspicion.\n- Payment Format_Cash = 1.0 \u2014 presence of a cash payment is associated here with decreased suspicion.\n- Amount Received = 55,287.58 \u2014 the comparatively large amount increases suspicion.\n- Hour = 9.0 and Weekday = 1.0 \u2014 transaction occurring at 09:00 on a weekday is associated with decreased suspicion."
