  "explanation_short": "This transaction is assessed as low risk (approximately 16% suspiciousness) because several attributes point toward routine, documentable activity while one attribute (the transaction amount) raises moderate attention; overall the factors that reduce concern outweigh the factor that increases it. The result is a low but non-zero level of scrutiny recommended for standard review.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 \u2014 absence of ACH involvement aligns with lower concern in this case.\n- Amount Paid = 1,351.40 \u2014 the monetary value is moderately elevated and increases the need for attention.\n- Weekday = 4.0 \u2014 transaction occurring on a weekday is consistent with normal business activity and reduces concern.\n- Amount Received = 1,351.40 \u2014 the received amount matches the paid amount, which decreases concern about unexplained value flows.\n- Payment Format_Cheque = 1.0 \u2014 use of cheque payment is associated here with greater traceability and reduces suspicion."
