  "explanation_short": "The transaction is assessed as highly suspicious (probability 0.9633) because it was sent via ACH and involves a relatively large payment, both of which are associated with increased risk in our screening. The late hour (22:00) modestly reduces concern, but the weekday code and the absence of a cheque payment further raise suspicion.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Payment Format_ACH = 1.0 \u2014 presence of an ACH payment is associated with increased risk.\n- Amount Paid = 2336.72 \u2014 the transaction amount is relatively large and increases suspicion.\n- Weekday = 0.0 \u2014 occurring on weekday code 0 is associated with higher risk in monitoring.\n- Payment Format_Cheque = 0.0 \u2014 absence of a cheque payment (electronic format) is associated with increased risk.\n- Hour = 22.0 \u2014 transaction time at 22:00 slightly decreases the level of concern."
