  "explanation_short": "This transaction is assessed as low risk (suspiciousness probability 0.0709) because several attributes lower concern while one factor raises a minor concern. The absence of ACH, presence of a cheque payment, a moderate received amount, and the late-hour timing reduce suspicion, whereas the matching amount paid slightly increases it.",
  "explanation_detailed": "Key risk-relevant factors:\n- Payment Format_ACH = 0.0 \u2014 absence of ACH reduces suspicion.\n- Amount Received = 6844.86 \u2014 moderate received amount reduces suspicion.\n- Payment Format_Cheque = 1.0 \u2014 cheque payment reduces suspicion.\n- Amount Paid = 6844.86 \u2014 outgoing amount equal to received increases suspicion.\n- Hour = 20.0 \u2014 transaction at 20:00 reduces suspicion."
